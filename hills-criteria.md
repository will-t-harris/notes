In 1963 a US surgeon general's advisory committee was tasked with determining how to assess the causal effects of smoking.

They stated that "to judge or evaluate the causal significance of the association between the attribute or agent and the disease, or effect upon health, a number of criteria must be utilized, no one of which is an all-sufficient basis for judgment." [^1]

The original 5 criteria from the committee were:
1. Consistency (many studies in different populations show similar results)
2. Strength of association (includes dose-response effect -- more smoking results in higher risk)
3. Specificity of the association (a particular agent should have a particular effect)
4. Temporal relationship (the effect should follow the cause)
5. Coherence (biological plausibility and consistency with other evidence)

[Austin Bradford Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Bradford_Hill), who was not on the original committee, added four more criteria to the list and they have become known, as a whole, as 'Hill's criteria.'
