# The Smoke-Filled Debate: Clearing the Air

Starts with the story of Jacob Yerushalmy (a biostatistician and [Abe Lilienfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lilienfeld) (an epidemiologist), who were both involved in the debate in the 50s and 60s over whether cigarette smoking caused cancer.

This was a difficult argument for statisticians to settle because there was no way to perform a [[randomized controlled trial]]. It would be unethical to ask someone to smoke for 30 years so that we could study the effects on their health.

The real issue was the argument that there might be a third factor that accounts for lung cancer, and for people's tendency toward nicotine addiction. It wasn't until 1964 that the debate was "settled" by a US Surgeon General's report that declared that "cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men."

## Tobacco: A Manmade Epidemic

In 1902, cigarettes made up ~2% of the US tobacco market.

By 1952 that figure was 81%. Automation and advertising grew the market dramatically

Before cigarettes lung cancer was rather rare. Between 1900 and 1950 it quadrupled in frequency, and by 1960 was the most common form of cancer in men.

[Richard Doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Doll) and [Austin Bradford Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Bradford_Hill) teamed up to figure out a way to examine the causes behind the cancer epidemic. 

They knew they couldn't perform a [[randomized controlled trial]], so they compared patients who had already been diagnosed with cancer to a control group of healthy volunteers. The interviewers were not told who had cancer and who did not, to avoid bias.

Their study showed an overwhelming correlation between smoking and cancer. Out of 649 cancer patients interviewed, all but 2 of them had been smokers.

The type of study they performed is now called a [[case-control study]] "because it compares 'cases' (people with a disease) to controls." [^1]

Some drawbacks of a [[case-control study]] that Pearl points to are:
1. It is retrospective, meaning they studied people who already had cancer and looked backward to discover why.
2. The probability logic is backward: the data tell us the probability that a cancer patient is a smoker instead of the probability that a smoker will get cancer.
3. It is susceptible to [[recall-bias]]
4. It is susceptible to [[selection-bias]]
