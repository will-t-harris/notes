## Bayesian Networks
- A [[causal diagram]] is a [[Bayesian network]] where every arrow "signifies a direct causal relation, or at least the possibility of one, in the direction of that arrow." [^1]
- [Bonaparte](https://www.bonaparte-dvi.com/) is a forensic tool that is used to identify victims of disasters using DNA from relatives and Bayesian networks.
- [[Bayesian network]]s are used in everyday applications
	- Speech-recognition software
	- Spam filters
	- Weather forecasting
	- Evaluation of potential oil wells
	- FDA's approval process for medical devices
	- Xbox game skill rankings
	- Belief propagation for cell phone signals
- Named, by Judea Pearl, after [Reverend Thomas Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes) who wrote a paper that was posthumously published by [Richard Price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Price)
- Bayes' original question was "how much evidence would it take to convince us that something we consider improbable has actually happened?" [^2]
	- The import of his question held theological importance at that time, but the significance to causality is through the ability to deduce the probability of a cause from an effect.
- Pearl supplies the example of a pool table:
	- [[Forward probability]] is asking: given the length of a pool table, what is the probability of the ball stopping within $x$ feet of the end of the table
	- [[Inverse probability]] is asking: given that the ball stopped $x$ feet from the end of the table, what is the likelihood that the table is a given length?
