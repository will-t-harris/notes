## 2 - Manage Your Tasks

- Todoist as main task manager
- Also creates a daily disposable task list to reference throughout the day

- Use Todoist filters to create views that are not offered by Todoist by default (3 week view, only priority 1, etc)
	- **This is a premium feature to add any custom filters**
- Use Todoist templates (can use menu to "export as template") for recurring tasks that have multiple steps
	- **This is a premium feature**
	- Templates are saved as local files that can be imported when needed
- Use repeating tasks to keep track of recurring things. NLP can make this happen ("every monday at 10 am" for example)

## 3 - Set Up Your Calendar

- Daily task list starts with the events for the day that are in the calendar already.
	- Given the events that are on the calendar, he can plan other tasks so that they fit in the gaps
- Create different calendars that contain information about different "life buckets." This could be work, social life, classes, etc.
- Create recurring calendar events for events that occur on a regular basis
- Add as much relevant information to events as possible, to make calendar entries as useful as possible
- Use "hidden calendars" that represent hours that things could happen (gym open, favorite restaurant open, etc) that can be quickly toggled on and off to see when you could fit something in.
