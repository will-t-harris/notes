## 2 - Manage Your Tasks

- Todoist as main task manager
- Also creates a daily disposable task list to reference throughout the day

- Use Todoist filters to create views that are not offered by Todoist by default (3 week view, only priority 1, etc)
	- **This is a premium feature to add any custom filters**
- Use Todoist templates (can use menu to "export as template") for recurring tasks that have multiple steps
	- **This is a premium feature**
	- Templates are saved as local files that can be imported when needed
- Use repeating tasks to keep track of recurring things. NLP can make this happen ("every monday at 10 am" for example)

## 3 - Set Up Your Calendar

- Daily task list starts with the events for the day that are in the calendar already.
	- Given the events that are on the calendar, he can plan other tasks so that they fit in the gaps
- Create different calendars that contain information about different "life buckets." This could be work, social life, classes, etc.
- Create recurring calendar events for events that occur on a regular basis
- Add as much relevant information to events as possible, to make calendar entries as useful as possible
- Use "hidden calendars" that represent hours that things could happen (gym open, favorite restaurant open, etc) that can be quickly toggled on and off to see when you could fit something in.

## Organize Your Digital Files

## Organize Your Physical Files

## Get Better at Email

- Don't touch an email if you aren't going to do something with it
- Archive emails you need to keep around (receipts, etc)
- When sending email, anticipate the questions/answers that might arise and include your thinking about them in the original communication.
- Use Todoist extension in gmail to quickly create tasks
- Immediately add things to calendar when events come through email
- Create filters to automate certain things, like moving receipts immediately into archive under a specific label for example

## Use Quick Capture

- Reduce the friction involved in getting information into your system
- Use a daily "scratch" note with unorganized random notes from the day, then organize and refine at the end of the day
- Get waterproof notebooks for the shower

## Schedule a Review Day

- Keep entropy at bay
- Recommends doing it on Sunday so you can plan and review at the same time
- Bring system back up to date
- Start with task management system and make sure everything is checked off that should be
- Remove lists/categories that are no longer relevant
- If you fall behind, just get through resetting so that the system can get back to being helpful
