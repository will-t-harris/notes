# [Power of Simplicity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdSD07U5uBs)
- Are ideas made out of "matter" or out of "light"?
	- If matter, they oppose each other, can't be in the same place at the same time
	- If light, we can have any number of ideas in the same place at the same time, no need to change between them
- Are ideas "things" or are the "processes"?

- In his view, businesses are shooting themselves in the foot by asking universities to crank out developers fluent in the languages that their legacy systems are built in. This stifles innovation, and increases technical debt. If there is no opportunity to try out better solutions, then no better solutions will be found.

- He's drawing an equivalence between the [Ptolemaic/Copernican epicyclic explanation of the planets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle) and the tendency to patch software projects rather than reconsidering the assumptions underlying the original approach.
- He calls it a natural human tendency.
- Apparently Kepler didn't try using ellipses to explain planetary motion **because he assumed that the people before him (whom he considered intelligent) had already tried ellipses and found them insufficient**

- How do you get simplicity?
- **Find a slightly more sophisticated building block out of which to build theories**
- Simple building blocks that anyone can understand through common sense often screw large organizations over because they might not allow for the degrees of freedom and scaling that they must go through to progress.

- Humans are excellent at coping, not excellent at progress (genetically)
	- He points to the period of human development where mankind basically did the same thing for hundreds of thousands of years. We're excellent at coping with the realities of our situation.


- If we treat our *beliefs* as *reality*, how sane are moments of revelation/inspiration?
	- They aren't sane. They go against the believed reality
	- Sanity is relative to the things we believe as true

- Learning a new idea requires almost as much creativity as the original invention

- **The goal is solving context, not just solving problems**
	- Finding what the real problem is is actually the big deal, and people will resist it every step of the way

- ARPA / Xerox PARC unified vision
	- Systems that are composed of mechanical parts (think gears) cannot scale past a certain point
	- Biological systems absolutely can (the human body is made up of ~100 trillion cells, and operates efficiently)
	- How can we make our mechanical/computing systems more closely resemble biological systems? 
	- **We can't scale *and* have central control** Must find a way to distribute control and responsibility in an "ecological" way.

- The greatest "idea killer" is worrying about how you'll arrive at the great idea you've set out as a 30 year goal. You can't be concerned with the incremental.
	- **"The present is the least interesting time to live in"**
	- **"Before you deal with the present, you have to deal with the future"**

- He thinks we're trying to get next stage UI out of last generation's machines
	- I think what he means is that the future capabilities of computers can't be encapsulated by the current technology. Which kind of sounds like a non-point to me. It seems obvious that the technology of the future will exceed the limitations of current hardware. What is he really driving at when talking about "next stage UI"?

- "Better" and "Perfect" are the two enemies of "What is Actually Needed"
	- Pick the thing that is just over the threshold. That is **qualitatively better** than all the other things you could do
