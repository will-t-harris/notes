It is possible to connect to localhost from the same network by visiting the ip address of your computer with your phone.

With Gatsby, you have to run the dev server at `0.0.0.0` instead of the default `127.0.0.1`

The command for this is `gatsby develop --host 0.0.0.0`
Then you can visit the ip address of your computer at the port that gatsby is running on
